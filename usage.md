####Usage of some common Data structures (found from GeeksforGeeks)

**Binary Search Tree** - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries.

**Binary Space Partition** - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered.

**Binary Tries** - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables.

**Hash Trees** - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available.

**Heaps** - Used in heap-sort; fast implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm; and in implementing efficient priority-queues, which are used in scheduling processes in many operating systems, Quality-of-Service in routers, and A** (path-finding algorithm used in AI applications, including video games).

**Huffman Coding Tree (Chip Uni)** - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats.

**GGM Trees** - Used in cryptographic applications to generate a tree of pseudo-random numbers.

**Syntax Tree** - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions.

**Treap** - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation.

**T-tree** - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so
