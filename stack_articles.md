Stack Artciles
==============

~~1. Introduction to Stack~~
 > Linear data structure. Supports push, pop, peek.
 
 > Implemented using linked list(dynamic size) and array(fixed size).
 
 > Used widely for maintaining history, undo,redo and program stack

2. Infix to Postfix Conversion using Stack

 > Read expression from left to right
 
 > If operand output it.
 
 > else 
    > if stack is empty || top element priority is less than curr element precedence push to stack.
    > else pop the operators from stack until previous condition
    > For open paranthesis push, for close paranthesis pop until open paranthesis.


3. Evaluation of Postfix Expression

> Postfix expression evaluation can be done faster in computers since higher priority elements are present first 

> create a stack to store operands.

> If operand push it to stack

> If operator pop two elements from stack; perform operation and push the result into stack.
